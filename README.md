# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository presents the study of fundamental algorithms and data structures using Python. It includes various practical exercises (TPs) designed to help understand key concepts, such as data manipulation, algorithm optimization, and problem-solving techniques.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Data Structures**: This includes classical structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each of these is explored in the context of real-world applications.
  
- **Algorithms**: We explore different algorithm types such as sorting, searching, and optimization. The focus is on understanding their efficiency, particularly in terms of time and space complexity.

- **Hands-on Exercises**: 
  - **![Bloom Filter](tpbloomfilter)** : A probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.
  - **![Iterator Pattern](TP4_it√©rateur)**: Practical implementation of the iterator design pattern.
  - **[Quick Sort](TP5_tres_rapide)**: Efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets.

## Purpose:  
The main goal of this repository is to provide a practical approach to mastering data structures and algorithms. Each exercise is designed to build on the previous ones, allowing the student to progressively deepen their understanding of how algorithms work and how to implement them efficiently in Python.
